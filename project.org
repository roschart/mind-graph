* Why
  I like anki and mindmaps. My problem with bouth is that anki not link flash
  cards, and mind maps software are for tree relationships, and only for that
  plain text with tabs is enough for me.

  I want something that allow me add concepts and relationships, similar to
  org-roam, and add capabilities for space repetion as anki.

  Problably done with emacs will org-roam and other plugins will be the correct
  path, but there are other objetive with this project, train my go abilities,
  that are needed for may carrer.

  I prefer other languages for this project, clojure will be my pricipal option
  for the dinamyc capabilites and REPL programming.

* Goals
** Allow add concepts in plain text.
   I like a lot use org-mode or markdown to store information and not depend of
   any dabasase to store the information.

   For the firsts prof of conceps, use json maybe is enough.
** Allow relations between conceps.
   Create links between conceps, but the links must be questions, example with
   the concept Spain, the question capital must link with Madrid.

** Learn go.
*** Json Seralization or equivalen
    Store the needed information y plain text formats, json, yaml, toml, etc
*** Console interfaces
    Use libraries that allow use the terminal, like k9 program.
*** Create graphs
    Use grapviz or similar to generate the graph of the concepts.
*** [Optional] Server and Web programing.
    Maybe in the future create a web server to interact with the backed, and
    facilitate the manipulation.
    
* Decision record
** Golang as lenguage.
   The reason is only instrumental, I need improve my golang skills. Problably
   if not clojure will be my prefer option.
** Pseudo petry networks.
   In petry networks there are nodes, and trigers, and strong rules. In this
   case I'm not creating a machine estate, is for that reason that is not needed
   follow all rules of petri networks, and made a simplification.
   The conceps will have he questions that trigger the next steps.
   
   #+begin_src markdown
   # Galicia.
   A Comunity of Spain
   # Relations
   ## Provincias
   [La Coru√±a] [Lugo] [Orense][Pontevera]
   ## Country
   [Spain]
   #+end_src

   The format is only a concept, but is clear the idea, one concept, with
   explantation or not, will have multiple reletions, each relation can link
   with one our multiple concepts.

   Is I'm studing Galica concept, the software can sugents 2 questions, when
   select one of them must show all the other concepts related.
